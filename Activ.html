    <!-- Adding your movie analysis content here -->
    <f2><h2>Your Favourite Dialogue and Why</h2>
    <p><strong>My favourite dialogue is “Hope is a dangerous thing it can drive a man insane”.</strong> This dialogue suits not only a prisoner but a common man. The dialogue tries to convey the message that hope is a good thing, but it becomes dangerous when one holds on to it for very long. Hope drives a man crazy because all his life he hopes for improvement but never makes any move; the endless wait can make a man mad.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Personal Review</h2>
    <p><strong>Shawshank redemption</strong> is a quite good movie. It is a beautiful way of portraying a simplistic story. A glimpse into the prison life and how everyone goes on to their daily life, what all problems, tasks, challenges a new inmate must face in prison.</p>
    <p>My favourite character was ‘Brooks’ and prison inmate who oversaw the library in the prison. He has been living in the prison since he was in his twenties and have grown old into a seventy-year-old man. Brooks is shown as a warm welcoming character in the movie, who is looking for someone to look after the library after he is gone. Brooks was the perfect example about how the life at prison can also be peaceful and quiet. After spending all his life in prison when he was finally released, he was unable to digest the new world. This showed irrespective of one's surroundings how one can be connected to a place even prison. At last, he kills himself because he has not known any life beyond the walls of prison and also all his friends were there at prison.</p>
    <p><strong>Shawshank redemption</strong> is one of the best movies I have ever watched. A perfect combination of direction, cinematography, and storytelling. The thing I love the most is even though it had a very simple story, yet it kept me hooked onto the screen.</p>

    <h2>Learning to Take Away from the Movie</h2>
    <p>This movie has a couple of takeaways:
    <ul>
        <li>One should never lose hope and keep on trying to find a way to his/her goal.</li>
        <li>One should always be careful of his colleagues or the people that work for him.</li>
    </ul></p>
